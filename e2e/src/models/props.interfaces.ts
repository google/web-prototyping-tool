// We're intentionally uncoupling interface definitions from what's
// defined in the app/cd-common/... code base:
//
// (1) We want to model closely what's seen in the UI, as we're doing e2e UI testing
// (2) If something breaks there in the code base, we want to be able to catch the
//     discrepancy.
// (3) If the change in the code base does not affect UI testing, we should be
//     oblivious about such change.)
//
// Modelling UI is also why opacity is opacityPercentage here.

// TODO : How do we do a more elaborate color-picker test?
